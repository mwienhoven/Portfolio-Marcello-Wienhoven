# Summary week 2
Results of the notebook from lesson 2:

## 1. Study more layers to add
I have looked at the links provided:
- Dropout https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Dropout.html
- normalization layers https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#normalization-layers

Especially the normalization layers are quite interesting. There are a lot of ways to normalize the layer. 

## 2. Add dropout and normalization layers to your model

## 3. Use logging

## 4. Adding convolutional and pooling layers
