    "`--host` tells the server we use our own machine (localhost), and `--port` specifies the port number on which the server will listen for incoming requests. In this case, we are using port 5000. Sometimes, you can have conflicts on a specific port and it could help to change the port (eg to 5001)\n",

    "After starting this up, go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser. You should see the MLflow UI, where you can explore your experiments, runs, and metrics. The UI provides a user-friendly way to visualize and compare different runs, making it easier to analyze the results of your hyperparameter optimization and model training."
