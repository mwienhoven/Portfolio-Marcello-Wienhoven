# Summary week 1
Results of the notebook from lesson 1:

## Change the number of epochs, eg to 5 or 10.

## Changing the amount of units1 and units2 to values between 16 and 1024. Use factors of 2 to easily scan the ranges: 16, 32, 64, etc.

## Changing the batchsize to values between 4 and 128. Again, use factors of two for convenience.

## Change the depth of your model by adding a additional linear layer + activation function

## Changing the learningrate to values between 1e-2 and 1e-5

## Changing the optimizer from SGD to one of the other available algoritms at [torch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html)
