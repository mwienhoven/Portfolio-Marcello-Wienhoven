# Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio contains a summary of my work, including machine learning exercises, a hackathon project, and critical reflections.

This website is built automatically using GitHub Pages. The main page you're reading right now is generated from the `README.md` file.

## Table of Contents

1.  **[Hyperparameter gridsearch](./1-hypertuning-gridsearch/summary.md)**
    * Summary of the first week in which we had to experiment with changing settings and reflect on how the models performance responds.
1.  **[Hyperparameter mlflow](./2-hypertuning-mlflow/summary.md)**
    * Summary of the second in which we had to experiment with changing settings and reflect on how the models performance responds using mlflow.
1.  **[Hyperparameter rnn](./3-hypertuning-rnn/summary.md)**
    * Summary of the third week in which we had to improve the rnn model by implementing different things (extra layers etc).
1.  **[Hyperparameter ray](./4-hypertuning-ray/summary.md)**
    * Summary of the fourth week in which we had to create and hypertune a model from scratch using Ray. The CIFAR-10 dataset and the CNN is used as dataset and model for the assignment.
1.  **[Deployment](./5-deployment/summary.md)**
    * Summary of the fifth week in which we had to deploy our own word predictor via SURF using docker and docker-compose. 
1.  **[Hackathon Model: Kadaster AI Akte](./6-hackathon/summary.md)**
    * The link to our Github we used during the Hackathon is provided in here.
1.  **[Ethics](./7-ethics/summary.md)**
    * The two portfolio assignments can be found here.
